      <div id="objective">
        <p>
          I am an energetic and outgoing young professional with a passion for
          web development. With a strong foundation in web technologies such as
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, I am committed to delivering
          high-quality and responsive web applications. As a quick learner, I
          adapt well to new technologies and frameworks. With excellent
          problem-solving and communication skills, I work well independently
          and as part of a team, and I'm always enthusiastic about pursuing new
          challenges and opportunities.
